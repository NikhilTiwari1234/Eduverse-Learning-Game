# EduVerse 🚀

EduVerse is a game-based learning platform built using Godot Engine, designed for the OpenAI x NxtWave Buildathon.

## 🎮 Concept
Users enter language-based portals (Python, Java, C, etc.) and attempt AI-generated quizzes inside an interactive 3D environment.

## 🤖 Use of Generative AI
Generative AI is used to create dynamic quiz questions for each programming language.
For this prototype, AI-generated content is simulated to ensure reliability under hackathon constraints.

## 🧠 Features
- Portal-based navigation
- Quiz system with scoring
- Level progression
- Option to continue or return to hub

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Godot Engine 4.x
- GDScript
- Generative AI (conceptual integration)

## 👨‍💻 Built For
OpenAI x NxtWave Buildathon 2025
